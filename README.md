# The FREE Minion Profits Tracker Scripts
Tired of guessing which minion is the most profitable? Tired of going through each minion using a huge brain script 'made available' by an influencer? Tired of spending hours changing minion levels on a spreadsheet? Tired of being poor, uncertain and in the dark about bazaar fluctuations? Well I present to you, **the FREE minion profits calculator script!**

## Features
 - Update bazaar prices automatically
 - Minion speeds, drops and merchant sell prices already stored
 - Compare item types sold to bazaar (base, enchanted or super-enchanted)
 - Easily compare fuel viabilities
 - Display data for every minion at once on really spicy looking graphs:

## Example Graphs
### Fuels [adding more soon]
This takes into account the price of the fuel per hour, as you can see, some fuel choices result in a net loss.

### Types sold
Some items might be worth selling to the merchant, or as their super-enchanted form to maximise profit. (I left the base price here, but it's a bit unfeasible as minions would fill up insanely quickly)

And finally, the piece de resistance...
### Minion rank
This one shows the evolution of the minion's rank in terms of profit, as it is leveled up.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to TBlazeWarriorT, I used a lot of the minion data from his famous spreadsheet, on top of painfully collecting my own.
Thanks to ThirtyVirus for providing the adequate situation in which I could release this tool.
If you spot any inconsistencies in the graphs or in the code, please let me know!!
